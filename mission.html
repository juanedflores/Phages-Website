      Our mission is to evaluate our digital spaces by considering its
      architecture and its material, how we move around them, how free we are in
      them, and how we consume and create inside them. When we began our
      collaboration, we shared an enthusiasm for open source software and DIY
      equipment to create generative and algorithmic art. It later expanded into
      a restless attempt of trying to make sense of our social medias and trying
      to stretch its functionality and possibility for creative expression
      outside of its intended use. Day to day features such as avatars and user
      interfaces became a possible medium to create with, not solely working and
      manipulating its apeparance, but also its functionality. We are not
      hackers, but we do code to create and find our limits.
