      Our mission is to evaluate our digital spaces by considering its
      architecture and its material, how we move around them, how free we are in
      them, and how we consume and create inside them.

      When we began our collaboration, an enthusiasm for open source software and DIY
      equipment was shared between us to create generative and algorithmic art. 
      It later expanded into a restless attempt to make sense of our social medias by trying
      to stretch their functionalities into possibilities for creative expression
      outside of their intended use. Day to day features such as avatars and user
      interfaces became a possible medium to create with, not solely working on
      manipulating its appearance, but also its functionality. <!--Creo que aquí puede ir otra palabra u otra oración, para que 'functionality' no se repita-->

      Are we hackers? We are not so sure, but we do code to create aesthetics that defy our limits.
