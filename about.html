      PHAGES is an artist collective of two creative coding artists,
      <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none; color: orange;">Juan Flores</a>
      and
      <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none; color: orange;">Isaac Medina</a
      >The start of our collaboration started in late 2016 in Mexico City when
      we began doing coding intensive audio-visual performances in various
      spaces such as The Department of Music at the National Autonomous
      University of Mexico, the Cultural Center of Spain (MX), and small house
      gallery shows. We then began to branch out in the US, eventually being
      featured artists at Connecticut College's Ammerman Center for Arts and
      Technology Biennial Simposium (New London, CT) in 2018, and Luminaria
      Contemporary Arts Festival (San Antonio, TX) in 2019. Today we continue to
      work digitally and submit projects globally as well as in the corners of
      cyberspace.
