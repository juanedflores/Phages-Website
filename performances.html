    A performer uses screens as an instrument and to symbolize eyes to flip
    around the idea of their heavy consumption. A second performer acts as a
    director and is in constant communication through MIDI and Open Sound
    Control messages. The screen monitor instrument uses an accelerometer and a
    contact microphone to create and manipulate sounds.
