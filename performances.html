    A performer uses screens as an instrument and to symbolize eyes to flip
    around the idea of their heavy consumption. A second performer acts as a
    director and is in constant communication through MIDI and Open Sound
    Control messages. The screen monitor instrument uses an accelerometer and a
    contact microphone to create and manipulate sounds.

    These-Eyes is a live coding performance with an interactive component from
    the viewers. A website is set up on Heroku to grab an image from
    thispersondoesnotexist periodically and scanned for eyes using OpenCV. These
    eyes are then constructed in a collage and presented on the top of the site
    and dynamically updated. Optionally, the public can submit their own eyes by
    interacting with the site these-eyes.herokuapp.com and turning on their
    webcam. During the live performance, this continually changing collection of
    eyes serves as our visual material to be manipulated in real time using the
    live coding environment Hydra . While I improvised in Hydra, Isaac Medina
    coded the algorithmic sounds using Tidalcycles .
