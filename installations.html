    Presented as part of Luminaria Contemporary Arts Festival,
    Post-Tw.In.Yo.Go.Fa., is the name of the dystopian digital realm that
    imagines life after the fall of five internet beasts (Twitter, Instagram,
    Youtube, Google, and Facebook). By using the hashtag #luminariasa people
    engaged with the artwork and were able to see their posts altered and
    disrupted on the screen in real time.
